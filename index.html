<h1>Trackballs</h1>
<p>
Trackballs is a marble game inspired by the 80s Atari classic Marble Madness.
</p>
<p>
By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth filled with sharp objects, pools of acid, and other obstacles the player collects points. When the destination is reached you continue on to the next, more difficult level &mdash; unless the time runs out.
</p>
<p>
Unlike Marble Madness the game uses 3D graphics even though the original game had no real use for it. Also the game is fully programmable with a scripting extension (Guile), and includes a level editor with which to easily create new levels. 
</p>
<p>
One of the goals of the game is to provide entertainment for children and adults alike. The main language for the sourcecode and all development of Trackballs is English but the game has been translated a few other languages including Swedish, German, Italian and French.
